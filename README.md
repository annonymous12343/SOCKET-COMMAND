# SOCKET-COMMAND
This script is a socket server made in python and a client and you can connect multiple clients and send commands to all of them at 1 time  also the server is making a website on http://localhost:6660 and you can send commands from the website too i dont have much time to solve the errors so let me know if you find important errors

to set this up you need to run the server first put your port and then open another termux or linux terminal type ifconfig on the device that runs the server if youre using termux you can copy the inet from wlan0 then run the client put the same port and the ip that you copied amd this is it good luck
